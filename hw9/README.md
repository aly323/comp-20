9a - Setlist using JSON

Part 1:  Create a JSON

Your assignment is to create a JSON to represent a set list for a cover band.  Each entry should have space to describe the artist(s), title, music genre(s), and year the song was released.

Note:  your object should allow each song to have multiple genre's 

You must include at least 10 songs.  The data must be real.  You may reuse the data from the XML assignment.  You must have songs from at least 3 genres (genre could be country, rock, pop, metal, ska, etc)

The JSON must be in its own file.

Part 2: Serialize and display

Display all data on page (serialized) as a raw string

Part 3: User friendly display 

Display all data in a user friendly format in a table or something like this: 

Who Loves You
Artist: The Four Seasons
Genre: rock, disco
Released 1975

Part 4: Filter the data

Create a form that allows the user to pick a genre.  The form should have a drop down box (<select>) listing the possible genres plus a button  labeled "Filter".  You must provide a choice of only the genres that are in the set list.  

When the user clicks the button, display only song titles from the selected genre in a user friendly format.

Note:  All items MUST be displayed on the page - not in an "alert"

09b - API Fun!

Task:  Your assignment is  to explore and use an API.
Requirements are:
It must be free
It must return the data in JSON format
It must be accessible with a GET request
 
Use the AJAX data pattern we learned to send a request to the API, retrieve some data and display the data. 

Include content on the web page for the following information:
describe the API you selected and what it does
cite the website where you found it
describe the options you used for the API request
give two applications where this API would be helpful.

Deliverables:  PDF with code - or link to code in github and URL
