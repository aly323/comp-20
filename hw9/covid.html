    <h2>Questions:</h2>
    <div class="question"> Describe the API you selected and what it does</div>
    <div> The API I selected has aggregate information about COVID 19 cases around the world. 
        You can get the most recent amount of positive cases per country, as well as the amount of 
        critical, recovered, and death cases. This API is just an example of the availability of public
        health information available during this pandemic.
    </div><br>

    <div class="question"> Cite the website where you found it</div>
    <div> I obtained this API documentation through
        <a href src="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11144369/Szf6Z9B3?version=latest">this</a>  website.</div><br>
    
    <div class="question"> Describe the options you used for the API request</div>
    <div> I obtained the COVID statistics in aggregate from countries in Europe, specifically looking 
        at the total amount of positive cases and the amount of cases that popped up today.</div><br>
    
    <div class="question"> Give two applications where this API would be helpful.</div>
    <div> 
        <ul>
            <li>This API is very useful for companies that want to seem updated and relevant during this pandemic. 
                Just to provide statistics and raise awareness in their employees.</li>
            <li>Another potential use for this API is for a student who is doing statistical research on COVID cases,
                just to track their changes over time, factoring by the country.
            </li>
        </ul>
