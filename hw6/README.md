This assignment will give you practice in using Javascript as a programming language.

Task: Use javascript to determine if two numbers are amicable.
  - Amicable = their factors (excluding themselves) add up to each other
    - Example: 220 and 284 are amicable
        factors(220) =  [1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110] → sum is 284
        factors(284) = [1, 2, 4, 71, 142] → sum is 220
